# GLFW3-test

This is just a simple game engine used for testing glfw version 3 and also
general design. This is by no means perfect - in fact, this is probably next to
useless. However, it might serve as documentation or a tutorial if nothing
else.

Libraries currently used by this project:
- GLFW version 3
- Libconfig
